fantastic Henry  morning Anna how's your report  thanks for helping me yesterday I'm  almost done with it  good to hear that Cube it up  can you help me print out this document  Henry  sure no problem Sarah wait a second  here's the coffee you asked me to buy  for you on the way to work today  thank you so much Henry  let's work hard today everyone  hello Henry  hey Henry I saw your report and it was  very detailed  good job man  [Music]  what's wrong with Henry today  I'm about to ask the same thing  yeah me too  he's always the one who runs around with us  you're right Henry is energetic and friendly  then he knows how to cheer us up  there must be something wrong with him  maybe his girlfriend dumped him yesterday  I don't think so as far as I know he  doesn't have a girlfriend or maybe because he lost all his money  what he was robbed  I guess so  it could not be that bad  whatever problems Henry had he must be  very sad and lost motivation to work  hey guys I've just come up with an idea  I suggest that we should take turns  cheering him up today how does that  sound  I'll go with it  me too  okay let's bring the old Henry back  [Music]  are you okay Henry  it's okay you don't have to tell me I  get it  you know it's not the end of the world  there's nothing to be sad about  I know that you really like coffee  take it  trust me after drinking it you will be  able to deal with every problem in life  yesterday I could not enter my house  because I lost my key  I knew you would be surprised  but don't worry I went to my friend's  house to sleep over  and I found out that I didn't lose my  key  I just left it on my desk in our office  hahaha  as you can see just because you have a  bad day doesn't mean you have a bad life  so cheer up Henry  [Music]  hey Henry  [Music]  I just want to say that your  presentation yesterday was perfect  everything you did went beyond our  expectations  just sending good thoughts and I hope  that you know you are more amazing than  you

that's right any problems  I have a little personal opinion to say  to be clear I have no objection to  Lucy's promotion  but I have been in the company for a  long time and I have devoted a lot to  the company  I just don't understand why I'm still  not getting a promotion or raise  I understand your concern  before answering your question I also  have a few questions for you  sure  as a person who works with Lucy what do  you think about her ability  very well she is a responsible person  but I am no less  all right stay calm  during your time working at the company  did any projects you work on help to  make a profit  hmm no but there are many reasons  it's not just me doing the project  other people also have responsibilities  I have always done my duty well  are you blaming me  I'm not blaming you you're a long time  staff of the company I do not deny your  contributions  but you haven't made any achievements  for the company  Lucy tries very hard and puts a lot of  effort into the development of the  company that's why she got promoted  you are also very good at your work  maybe if you try harder in the future I  will consider promoting you to a higher  position  I got it
