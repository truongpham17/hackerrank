Scrum Master: Good morning everyone, let's kick off the daily Scrum. Who would
like to start off and fill us in on your progress?
Developer 1: I'll start. Yesterday, I wrapped up the frontend of the registration page
and today, I’m going to get started on the backend integration.
Scrum Master: Great work. Do you have any blockers?
Developer 1: No, I'm not running into any issues at the moment.
Scrum Master: Alright, let's move on to the next person. What did you get done
yesterday?
Developer 2: I finished up the testing on the login page and began working on
fixing a bug that the QA team discovered.
Scrum Master: Excellent, do you need a hand with the bug fix?
Developer 2: No, I think I can handle it on my own.
Scrum Master: Alright, does anyone else have any issues to report?
Developer 3: Yes, I'm struggling with a problem related to database connectivity.
I've tried to fix it but I can't figure out the root cause.
Scrum Master: Okay, seems like it could be complicated. Let's take this offline. Is
there anything else that needs to be addressed before we wrap things up?
Scrum Meeting
Product Owner: Yes, I've added some new features to the backlog that we need to
prioritise. Can we go over them in the next meeting?
Scrum Master: Absolutely, I’ll make a note of it. Thanks everyone for your updates.
Keep up the good work!
